## Installation

### Direct Download

You can download the latest pre-built application for your platform:

- [macOS (DMG)](https://github.com/timetime-software/mcp-manager/raw/main/release/MCP%20Manager-1.0.0.dmg)
- [macOS (ZIP)](https://github.com/timetime-software/mcp-manager/raw/main/release/MCP%20Manager-1.0.0-mac.zip)

### Building from Source

If you prefer to build the application yourself:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iagolast/mcp-manager.git
   cd mcp-manager
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the application:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. Create distributables:
   ```bash
   npm run dist
   ```

The built application will be available in the `release` directory.

## Development

### Running in Development Mode

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iagolast/mcp-manager.git
   cd mcp-manager
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

This will launch both the Vite development server for the React frontend and the Electron application.

### Project Structure

- `src/renderer`: React application code (UI components)
- `src/renderer/components`: React components organized by feature
- `src/renderer/services`: Services for managing configuration and server communication
- `src/renderer/types`: TypeScript type definitions
- `electron`: Electron main process code

### UI Components

The application uses a component-based architecture with Mantine UI:

- **AppShell**: Main layout container with header, footer, and content areas
- **ServerManager**: Central component for managing MCP servers
- **ServerCard**: Individual server display with status and actions
- **ServerDialog**: Form for adding and editing servers
- **DeleteConfirmDialog**: Confirmation dialog for server deletion
- **ImportJsonDialog**: Dialog for importing server configurations from JSON

### Testing

Run the tests with:

```bash
npm test
```

For development with continuous testing:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```
